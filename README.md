# Hospital Management Site

This is a collaboration with some classmates to make a hospital management website using Java EE, SQL Server, Hibernate, Bootstrap, Maven, Git and Tomcat.

<h2>How to run</h2>
Run by cloning the repo, importing it as a maven project and editing hibernate.cfg.xml's connection string to point to your own database

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
sqljdbc4.jar(The Java-SQL connector) cannot be downloaded by Maven due to licencing issues with Microsoft and must be added manually.
